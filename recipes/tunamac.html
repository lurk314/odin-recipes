    <p><img src="../img/tunamac.jpeg" alt="picture of tuna mac"></p>
    <p>So thisis one of my favorites. It is easy, quick and great for kids.</p>
    <p>First you'll need:</p>
    <p><ul>
        <li>1 box of your favorite Mac & Cheese</li>
        <li>A little milk</li>
        <li>Spoonfull of mayonase</li>
        <li>A bit of butter</li>
        <li>1 can of albacore tuna</li>
        <li>some shreaded chease (preferably mexican blend)</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p><strong>So to start</strong></p>, 
        <p><ol>
            <li>cook your box of Mac to your liking (I like mine a little 
                aldente)</li>
            <li>Then you are going to want to strain the water</li>
            <li>add in a heaping tablespoon of mayo, a chunk of butter and a nice splash of milk</li>
            <li>Mix it all up and you are ready for your can of tuna.</li> 
            <li> make sure you drain the water out of your can first</li>   
        </ol></p>
        <p>you may also want to add pepper or some other seasoning 
            if you preffer. But I think that about does it for the easy <em>Tuna Mac</em></p>
