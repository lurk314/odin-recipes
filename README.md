    This small webpage is just to showcase my understanding of HTML, how i worksand some functions and tabs. This is my first project what i've learned is: how to create a boarderplate -make a heading -ordered and unordered lists -several html tags such as <strong>, <em>, <p>, <li>, ect. I successfully created a github repo show showcase my work and to recieve constructive criticism. 

    This page also reflects my ability and understanding of how to create directories in linux, and commit and push my work to github. In this site Ive made it clear I can create links and filepaths add pictures and create a basic HTML webpage starting from nothing.

    I know its not much but it is my first and I feel the code is organized and clear enough for people to read. Thanks
